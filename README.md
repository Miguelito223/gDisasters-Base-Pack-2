Disable gdisasters base pack 1, is causing incompatibility!!
You also need the gdisasters materials pack full
Also disable xtwisters that shit causes incompatibility in the fire tornado 

questions:

Q: Why doesn't the gdisasters menu appear?
A: Because you have gdisasters base pack 1 or gdisasters old version activate, please disable it. Another reason is because your pc is not powerful enough to support it.

Q: Why I getting crashed?
A: Because you have beta 64 or 32 installer. please unistall that, is causing crash. 

Q: how do i hide the hud?
A: with the command "gdisasters_hud_enabled"

Q: Why I getting Message "This map is incompatible with this addon!" ?
A: Because you are in a incompatible map, please use "gdisasters_ncompat_maps" command to see compatible maps

Q: Why don't work the smart tornado? how smart tornadoes work?
A:  The smart tornado follow the paths of the compatible map. if smart tornadoes don't work, is because you are in a incompatible map. Use "gdisasters_tornadocompat_maps" to see compatible maps

Q: How do I add more maps to the mod compatible list?
A: in discussions you have a tutorial on how to do it, if you still have the doubt, check the github or simply tell me the map you want so that I can add it to the list, you can also help with S37K, which is a very good complement to get the mapbounds and I also did a recent mod that added commands go check it out [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2921980754&searchtext=s37k] Here [/url]

Q: Why the autospawn not work? 
A: is because a bug or error I committed, notify me of the error and while I try to fix it use it: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1520063045] Here [/url]

Q: Why the gdisasters spawnmenu no work in multiplayer? Why am I getting errors of "Couldn't include file" ?
A: because you have the outdated mod, try to reinstall the mod or else the game. Another reason may be because you have the gdisasters base pack 1 or another mod that causes that problem. Please disable it. 

Q: Why screen is black?
A: Because something is breaking the body temperature, just disable it with the command "gdisasters_hud_temp_effects"

Q: I can't solve my problem, where can i ask for help?
A: If you continue with the problem I recommend that you ask for help in our discord

Q: I would like to help in the project, where can I contact?
